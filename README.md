## **V1.0 RELEASED** 

This is a personal project which started for fun.

I recently had the necessity to create my own color theme so I could enjoy programming more and more.
There were a lot of themes that could not satisfy me, or they would just partially, even some of them would give me a headache just by looking at them for like a two seconds.
It is inspired on a mix of retro/cyber/synth - wave aesthetics and my personal touch.

This is my first try doing this so... Let's see what happens. If you like it just get it and let me know ; )
